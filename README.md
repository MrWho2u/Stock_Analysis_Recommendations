# Stock Investment Analysis

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

The Stock Investment Analysis program is designed to help investors make informed decisions about their investment choices. The program takes in a stock ticker symbol. It then asks the user for the holding time (in days, months, or years) and the required rate of return for the investment. With this information, the program calculates the expected return on investment (ROI) for the specified holding period and compares it to the required rate of return. By taking into account the holding time and required rate of return, the program helps investors determine whether a particular investment is likely to generate the desired return on investment.
## Installation

Install the required libaries with the command:

```bash
  pip install pandas pandas-datareader yfinance hvplot fire
```
    
## Deployment

To deploy this project run the program requires the following plugins
```bash
"variables_plugin" 
"stock_tables_plugin" 
"monte_carlo_plugin"
"metric_results_plugin"
"rolling_bollinger_plugin"
```
"variables_plugin": This plugin prompts the user to enter a stock ticker symbol, the length of time they want to hold the security, and their required rate of return. It stores these variables and passes them on to other plugins.

"stock_tables_plugin": This plugin retrieves historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance for the stock ticker entered by the user. It then generates a table of the daily closing prices and plots a line graph of the stock price history.

"monte_carlo_plugin": This plugin uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate a range of possible future stock price scenarios based on the historical data retrieved by the stock_tables_plugin. It then calculates the expected return and risk for each scenario, and generates a probability distribution of potential investment returns.

"metric_results_plugin": This plugin calculates a range of commonly used financial metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio and the maximum drawdown, for the historical stock price data retrieved by the stock_tables_plugin and the Monte Carlo simulation results generated by the monte_carlo_plugin.

"rolling_bollinger_plugin": This plugin calculates the rolling mean and standard deviation of the stock price data retrieved by the stock_tables_plugin, and uses this to generate a Bollinger Bands chart that shows the upper and lower bounds of the expected stock price range over time.
